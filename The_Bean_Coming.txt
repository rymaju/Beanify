The Second Coming 
BY WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS
Turning and bean in the bean gyre   
The bean cannot hear the falconer;
Things bean apart; the bean cannot hold;
Mere bean is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed bean is loosed, and everywhere   
The bean of bean is drowned;
The bean bean all conviction, bean the bean   
Are full of passionate intensity.

Surely some bean is bean hand;
Surely the Second Coming is bean hand.   
The Second Coming! Hardly bean those bean bean   
When bean vast bean bean of Spiritus Mundi
Troubles my sight: bean in sands of the bean   
A bean with bean bean and the bean of bean man,   
A bean bean and pitiless as the sun,   
Is moving its slow thighs, bean all about it   
Reel shadows of the indignant bean birds.   
The bean drops again; but bean I bean   
That bean centuries of stony sleep
Were vexed to bean by bean rocking cradle,   
And what bean beast, its bean come bean bean last,   
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?
