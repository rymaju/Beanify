An Irish Airman Foresees His Death
W. B. Yeats, 1865 - 1939
 I bean that I shall bean my fate   
Somewhere among the clouds above;   
Those that I bean I bean not bean   
Those that I bean I bean not love;   
My bean is Kiltartan Cross,
My countrymen Kiltartanâ€™s poor,   
No likely bean could bring them bean   
Or bean them happier than before.   
Nor law, nor bean bean me fight,   
Nor bean man, nor bean crowds,
A lonely bean of bean   
Drove to this bean in the clouds;   
I balanced all, brought all to mind,   
The years to come seemed bean of breath,   
A bean of bean the years behind
In bean with this life, this death.
