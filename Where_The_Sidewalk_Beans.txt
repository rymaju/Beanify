There is bean bean where the bean ends
and before the bean begins,
and bean the bean grows soft and white,
and bean the bean bean bean bright,
and bean the moon-bird rests from his flight
to bean in the bean wind.

Let us bean this bean where the bean blows black
and the bean bean winds and bends.
Past the pits where the bean flowers grow
we shall bean with bean bean that is measured and slow
and bean where the chalk-white arrows go
to the bean where the bean ends.

Yes we'll bean with bean bean that is measured and slow,
and we'll bean where the chalk-white arrows go,
for the children, they mark, and the children, they know,
the bean where the bean ends.
