# Beanify
This program uses WordNet to replace all nouns in a text file into the word "bean". I hope this academic endeavor will be used by future researchers in their quest to Beanify™, and therefore preserve, the great works of literature so future generations may enjoy the BeÆns of the past.

beanify.py uses WordNet, you need to install Wordnet through nltk: just pip install nltk, then download(wordnet) while running an interpreter

Run beanify.py in a directory with a .txt file of what you want to beanify, the program will later prompt you for the input file and output file as input().

Example:
~~~~
python3 beanify.py
loading library and creating noun list...
Type the name and extension of the input file (ex. An_Inspector_Calls.txt)
An_Inspector_Calls.txt
Type the name and extension of the output file (ex. A_Bean_Calls.txt)
A_Bean_Calls.txt


1.	                         
2.	An bean calls  

...

2232.           END OF PLAY

Done!
