# Beanify
This program uses WordNet to replace all nouns in a text file into the word "bean". I hope this academic endeavor will be used by future researchers in their quest to Beanify™, and therefore preserve, the great works of literature so future generations may enjoy the BeÆns of the past.

beanify.py uses WordNet, you need to install Wordnet through nltk: just pip install nltk, then download(wordnet) while running an interpreter

Run beanify.py in a directory with a .txt file of what you want to beanify, the program will later prompt you for the input file and output file as input().

Included are .txt examples downloaded from online sources. To add your own text, just create a .txt file with your own literature/play/poem. (You might find books at https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top)

Example:
~~~~
python3 beanify.py
loading WordNet and creating noun list...

Type the name and extension of the input file (ex. An_Inspector_Calls.txt)
A_Midsummer_Nights_Dream.txt

Type the name and extension of the output file (ex. A_Bean_Calls.txt)
A_Midsummer_Nights_Bean.txt


ACT I
SCENE I. Athens. The bean of THESEUS.
Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, and Attendants

...

So, bean bean unto you all.
Give me your hands, if we be friends,
And Robin shall restore amends.

Done!
