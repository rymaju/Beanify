# Beanify
This program uses WordNet to replace all nouns in a text file into the word "bean". I hope this academic endeavor will be used by future researchers in their quest to Beanify™, and therefore preserve, the great works of literature so future generations may enjoy the BeÆns of the past.

Dedicated to Ms. Abdallah and Patrick Quip
