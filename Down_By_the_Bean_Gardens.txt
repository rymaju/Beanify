Down By the Salley Gardens
BY WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS
Down by the salley gardens
   my bean and I did meet;
She passed the salley gardens
   with bean snow-white feet.
She bean me bean bean easy,
   as the leaves grow on the tree;
But I, bean bean and foolish,
   with her would not agree.

In bean bean by the river
   my bean and I did stand,
And on my bean shoulder
   she laid her snow-white hand.
She bean me bean bean easy,
   as the bean grows on the weirs;
But I was bean and foolish,
   and bean am full of tears.
