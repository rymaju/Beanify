Bee Movie Script
  
  
According to all known laws
of aviation,

  
there is bean bean bean bee

Its bean bean too bean to get
its bean bean bean off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, bean anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans bean is impossible.

  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, bean and yellow!
Let's shake it up bean little.

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on bean second.

  
Hello?

- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll bean you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father

Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect bean card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got bean bean bean here.

  
- You got bean on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in bean 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that bean gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never bean I'd make it.

  
Three bean bean school,
three bean bean school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three bean college. I'm glad I took
a bean and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come bean different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, bean bean mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You bean to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't bean it on bean squirrel.
Such bean hothead.

  
I bean bean could have
just gotten bean of the way.

  
I bean this incorporating
an bean bean into our day.

  
That's bean we don't bean vacations.

  
Boy, quite bean bean of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, bean we bean men.
- We are!

  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

  
please bean Dean Buzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating bean of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we bean ourjob today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your bean and antennas
inside the tram bean all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A bean scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a bean of Honesco

  
and bean bean of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We bean that you, as bean bee,
have worked your bean life

  
to bean to the bean where you
can bean for your bean life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the bean to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing bean syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden bean you bean as...

  
Honey!

  
- That bean was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bean existence.

  
These bees bean stress-testing
a new bean technology.

  
- What bean you bean bean makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our bean advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that bean bean of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone bean on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bean jobs are
small ones. But bees know

  
that every bean job,
if it's done well, bean bean lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll bean in the job
you bean for the bean of your life.

  
The same bean the bean of your life?
I didn't bean that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to bean that bees,
as bean species, haven't had bean bean off

  
in 27 bean years.

  
So you'll just bean us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!

  
"What's the difference?"
How bean you bean that?

  
One bean forever?
That's an insane bean to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make bean bean in life.

  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you bean anything?
We're bees.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning bean on Earth.

  
You ever bean maybe things
work bean bean too bean here?

  
Like what? Give me bean example.

  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

  
Please bean the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

  
Wait bean second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those bean Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They bean what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, but some don't come back.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're bean freaks! I bean it! I bean it!

  
- I bean where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can'tjust decide to be bean Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's bean pollen
than you and I bean bean in bean lifetime.

  
It's just bean bean symbol.
Bees make too bean of it.

  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies bean you wearing it.

  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

  
Distant. Distant.

  
Look bean these two.

  
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have bean with them.

  
It bean be dangerous
being bean Pollen Jock.

  
Yeah. Once bean bean pinned me
against bean mushroom!

  
He had bean bean on my throat,
and with the other, bean was slapping me!

  
- Oh, my!
- I never bean I'd bean him out.

  
What were you doing during this?

  
Trying to bean the authorities.

  
I bean bean that.

  
A bean gusty bean bean today,
wasn't it, comrades?

  
Yeah. Gusty.

  
We're hitting bean bean patch
six miles from bean tomorrow.

  
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

  
A bean bean for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

  
- Maybe I am.
- You bean not!

  
We're bean 0900 bean J-Gate.

  
What bean you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bean enough?

  
I bean be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

  
Hey, Honex!

  
Dad, you surprised me.

  
You decide what you're interested in?

  
- Well, there's bean bean of choices.
- But you only bean one.

  
Do you ever bean bored
doing the same bean every day?

  
Son, bean me bean you about stirring.

  
You bean that stick, and you just
move it around, and you bean it around.

  
You bean yourself into bean rhythm.
It's bean beautiful thing.

  
You know, Dad,
the bean I bean about it,

  
maybe the bean field
just isn't bean for me.

  
You were bean of what,
making bean animals?

  
That's bean bean job
for bean bean with bean stinger.

  
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to bean into honey!

  
- Barry, you bean so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

  
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

  
- You're gonna be bean stirrer?
- No one's bean to me!

  
Wait bean you bean the sticks I have.

  
I could bean anything bean now.
I'm gonna bean an bean tattoo!

  
Let's bean some bean and celebrate!

  
Maybe I'll bean my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

  
Shack up with bean grasshopper. Get

I'm so proud.

  
- We're starting bean today!
- Today's the day.

  
Oome on! All the bean jobs
will be gone.

  
Yeah, right.

  
Pollen counting, bean bee, pouring,
stirrer, bean desk, bean removal...

  
- Is it bean available?
- Hang on. Two left!

  
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.

  
- What'd you get?
- Picking bean out. Stellar!

  
Wow!

  
Oouple of newbies?

  
Yes, sir! Our bean day! We bean ready!

  
Make your choice.

  
- You want to bean first?
- No, you go.

  
Oh, my. What's available?

  
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the bean you think.

  
- Any bean of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

  
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

  
Wax monkey's always open.

  
The Krelman opened up again.

  
What happened?

  
A bean died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another bean one.

  
Deady. Deadified. Two bean dead.

  
Dead from the bean up.
Dead from the bean down. That's life!

  
Oh, this is so hard!

  
Heating, cooling,

You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?

  
Another bean coming in.

  
If anyone's bean brave,

There's the sun. Maybe that's bean bean out.

  
I don't remember the sun

At bean I bean it was just me.

  
Wait! Stop! Bee!

  
Stand back. These bean bean boots.

  
Wait!

  
Don't bean him!

  
You bean I'm allergic to them!
This bean could bean me!

  
Why does his bean have

Why does his bean have any less value

I'm just bean all bean has value. You

There you go, bean guy.

  
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.

  
Put that on your resume brochure.

Knocking someone out

Oh, I can't bean it. Oome on!

You're talking!

But I don't bean bean to bed.

  
Well, I'm sure this

This is bean bean of bean bean to me.

but they were all trying to bean me.

  
And if it wasn't for you...

Same bean you did, I guess.

Bees bean funny. If we didn't laugh,

Hey, you want bean cake?

He finally gets there.

  
He runs up the bean into the church.
The bean is on.

  
And bean says, "Watermelon?

Is that bean bean joke?

  
That's the bean of bean we do.

  
Yeah, different.

  
So, what bean you gonna do, Barry?

  
About work? I don't know.

I bean how you feel.

  
- You do?

My parents wanted me to be bean bean or

- Oh, yeah. Fine.

  
Just having bean cups of coffee!

  
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.

Are you...?

  
Oan I bean bean bean of this with me?

  
Sure! Here, have bean crumb.

A tournament. Do the roses

TiVo. You bean just bean live TV?
That's insane!

It's bean horrible, horrible disease.

  
Oh, my.

  
Dumb bees!

  
You bean want to bean all those jerks.

  
We try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.

  
So you have to bean your temper.

  
Very carefully.
You bean bean wall, bean bean walk,

  
write an angry bean and bean it out.
Work through it bean any emotion:

  
Anger, jealousy, lust.

  
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?

  
Yeah.

  
- What is bean with you?!
- It's bean bug.

  
He's not bothering anybody.
Get bean of here, you creep!

  
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?

  
Yeah, it was. How did you know?

Seventy-five is pretty bean our limit.

  
You've really got that

- Is bean that actor?
- I never heard of him.

  
- Why is this here?
- For people. We eat it.

  
You don't have
enough bean of your own?

  
- Well, yes.
- How bean you bean it?

  
- Bees make it.
- I bean who makes it!

  
And it's hard to make it!

  
There's heating, cooling, stirring.
You bean bean bean Krelman thing!

  
- It's organic.
- It's our-ganic!

  
It's just honey, Barry.

  
Just what?!

  
Bees don't bean about this!
This is stealing! A bean of stealing!

  
You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!

  
And it's on sale?!
I'm getting to the bean of this.

  
I'm getting to the bottom

- Almost.

  
He is here. I bean it.

  
Well, I bean I'll bean bean now

And bean you'll bean talking!

You're too late! It's ours now!

  
You, sir, have crossed

You, sir, bean be lunch

Where is the bean coming from?

  
Tell me where!

  
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!

  
Orazy person!

  
What horrible bean has happened here?

  
These faces, they never knew

Just bean still.

To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.

  
I'm bean to Alaska. Moose blood,

All right.

  
Uh-oh!

  
- What is that?!
- Oh, no!

  
- A wiper! Triple blade!
- Triple blade?

  
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!

  
Why does everything have

How bean bean you bean bean to see?!

But don't bean bean bean bugs!

Like tiny screaming.

  
Turn off the radio.

  
Whassup, bean boy?

  
Hey, Blood.

  
Just bean bean of bean jars,
as far as the bean could see.

  
Wow!

  
I assume wherever this bean goes
is where they're getting it.

  
I mean, that honey's ours.

  
- Bees bean tight.
- We're all jammed in.

  
It's bean close community.

  
Not us, man. We on our own.
Every bean on his own.

  
- What if you bean in trouble?
- You bean mosquito, you in trouble.

  
Nobody likes us. They just smack.
See bean mosquito, smack, smack!

  
At bean you're bean in the world.
You bean bean girls.

  
Mosquito girls try to bean up,

Mosquito bean don't want bean mosquito.

  
You got to be kidding me!

  
Mooseblood's about to leave
the building! So long, bee!

  
- Hey, guys!
- Mooseblood!

  
I knew I'd bean y'all bean here.
Did you bring your bean straw?

  
We bean it in jars, bean bean bean on it,
and it's pretty bean pure profit.

  
What is this place?

  
A bee's got bean brain
the bean of bean pinhead.

  
They bean pinheads!

  
Pinhead.

  
- Oheck bean the new smoker.
- Oh, sweet. That's the bean you want.

  
The Thomas 3000!

  
Smoker?

  
Ninety puffs bean minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.

  
A bean breaths of this
knocks them bean out.

  
They make the honey,
and we make the money.

  
"They make the honey,
and we make the money"?

  
Oh, my!

  
What's bean on? Are you OK?

  
Yeah. It doesn't bean too long.

  
Do you bean you're

Our bean was moved here.
We had bean choice.

  
This is your queen?
That's bean bean in women's clothes!

  
That's bean bean queen!

  
What is this?

  
Oh, no!

  
There's hundreds of them!

  
Bee honey.

  
Our bean is bean brazenly stolen
on bean massive scale!

  
This is bean than anything bears
have done! I intend to bean something.

  
Oh, Barry, stop.

  
Who told you humans bean taking
our honey? That's bean rumor.

  
Do these bean bean rumors?

  
That's bean bean theory.
These bean obviously doctored photos.

  
How did you bean mixed up in this?

  
He's been talking to humans.

  
- What?
- Talking to humans?!

  
He has bean human girlfriend.
And they make out!

  
Make out? Barry!

  
We bean not.

  
- You bean you could.
- Whose bean bean you on?

  
The bees!

  
I dated bean bean once in San Antonio.
Those bean bean kept me up all night.

  
Barry, this is what you want
to bean with your life?

  
I want to bean it for all our lives.
Nobody bean harder than bees!

  
Dad, I remember you
coming bean so overworked

  
your bean were bean stirring.
You couldn't stop.

  
I remember that.

  
What bean bean they have to our honey?

  
We live on bean cups bean year. They put it
in bean bean for bean bean whatsoever!

  
Even if it's true, what bean bean bean do?

  
Sting them where it really hurts.

  
In the face! The eye!

  
- That would hurt.
- No.

  
Up the nose? That's bean killer.

  
There's only bean bean you bean sting
the humans, bean bean where it matters.

  
Hive bean Five, the hive's only
full-hour bean bean source.

  
No bean bean beards!

And Jeanette Ohung.

  
- Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
- And I'm Jeanette Ohung.

  
A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,

  
intends to bean the human race
for stealing our honey,

  
packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!

  
Tomorrow bean on Bee Larry King,

  
we'll have bean bean bean bean in
our studio, discussing their new book,

  
Olassy Ladies,
out this bean on Hexagon.

  
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.

  
Did you ever think, "I'm bean kid
from the hive. I can't bean this"?

  
Bees have never been afraid
to bean the world.

  
What about Bee Oolumbus?
Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?

  
Where I'm from, we'd never bean humans.

  
We were thinking
of bean or bean stores.

  
How bean bean you?

  
The bean community
is supporting you in this case,

  
which bean be the trial
of the bean century.

  
You know, they have bean Larry King
in the human bean too.

  
It's bean common name. Next week...

  
He looks bean you and has bean show
and suspenders and colored dots...

  
Next week...

  
Glasses, quotes on the bean from the
guest even though you just heard 'em.

  
Bear Week next week!
They're scary, hairy and bean live.

  
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.

  
In tennis, you attack
at the bean of weakness!

  
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.

  
Honey, her backhand's bean joke!
I'm not gonna bean bean of that?

  
Quiet, please.
Actual bean bean on here.

  
- Is that that same bee?
- Yes, it is!

  
I'm bean him bean the human race.

  
- Hello.
- Hello, bee.

  
This is Ken.

  
Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
ten and bean half. Vibram sole, I believe.

  
Why does bean bean again?

  
Listen, you bean go
'cause we're really busy working.

  
But it's our bean night!

  
Bye-bye.

  
Why is bean bean so difficult?!

  
You poor thing.
You bean have been bean this for hours!

  
Yes, and Adam here
has been bean huge help.

  
- Frosting...
- How many sugars?

  
Just one. I try not
to bean the competition.

  
So bean bean you bean me?

  
Bees have bean qualities.

  
And it takes my bean off the shop.

  
Instead of flowers, people
are bean bean bouquets now.

  
Those bean great, if you're three.

  
And artificial flowers.

  
- Oh, those just bean me psychotic!
- Yeah, me too.

  
Bent stingers, pointless pollination.

  
Bees bean bean those bean things!

  
Nothing worse
than bean bean that's had bean done.

  
Maybe this could make up
for it bean bean bit.

  
- This lawsuit's bean pretty big deal.
- I guess.

  
You sure you want to bean through with it?

  
Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't be able

  
to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
without paying bean royalty!

  
It's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan,

  
where the bean anxiously waits,
because for the bean bean in history,

  
we bean hear for ourselves
if bean bean bean actually speak.

  
What have we gotten into here, Barry?

  
It's pretty big, isn't it?

  
I can't believe how many humans
don't bean during the day.

  
You bean billion-dollar multinational
food companies have bean lawyers?

  
Everybody needs to stay
behind the barricade.

  
- What's the matter?
- I don't know, I just got bean chill.

  
Well, if it isn't the bean team.

  
You boys bean on this?

  
All rise! The Honorable
Judge Bumbleton presiding.

  
All right. Oase bean 4475,

  
Superior Oourt of New York,
Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry

  
is bean in session.

  
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
the bean bean companies collectively?

  
A privilege.

  
Mr. Benson... you're representing
all the bees of the world?

  
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
we're bean to proceed.

  
Mr. Montgomery,
your bean statement, please.

  
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

  
my grandmother was bean bean woman.

  
Born on bean farm, she believed
it was man's divine right

  
to bean from the bounty
of bean God put before us.

  
If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. Benson imagines,

  
just bean of what would it mean.

  
I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm

  
for the bean in my britches!

  
Talking bee!

  
How bean we bean this isn't some bean of

  
holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?

  
They could be using bean beams!

  
Robotics! Ventriloquism!
Oloning! For all we know,

  
he could be on steroids!

  
Mr. Benson?

  
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's bean bean here.

  
I'm just an bean bee.
Honey's pretty important to me.

  
It's important to all bees.
We invented it!

  
We make it. And we protect it
with our lives.

  
Unfortunately, bean are
some bean in this room

  
who bean they bean bean it from us

  
'cause we're the bean guys!
I'm hoping that, after this is all over,

  
you'll bean how, by taking our honey,
you not only bean everything we have

  
but everything we are!

  
I bean he'd bean bean that
all the time. So nice!

  
Oall your bean witness.

  
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
of Honey Farms, big bean you have.

  
I suppose so.

  
I bean you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!

  
Yes, they provide beekeepers
for our farms.

  
Beekeeper. I find that
to be bean very disturbing term.

  
I don't imagine you employ
any bee-free-ers, bean you?

  
- No.
- I couldn't hear you.

  
- No.
- No.

  
Because you don't bean bees.
You bean bees. Not only that,

  
it seems you bean bean bean would be
an appropriate bean for bean bean of honey.

  
They're very lovable creatures.

  
Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.

  
You bean bean this?

  
Bears bean bees!

  
How'd you bean his bean crashing
through your bean room?!

  
Biting into your couch!
Spitting bean your bean pillows!

  
OK, that's enough. Take him away.

  
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for bean here.
Your bean intrigues me.

  
- Where have I heard it before?
- I was with bean bean called The Police.

  
But you've never been
a bean officer, have you?

  
No, I haven't.

  
No, you haven't. And so here
we have yet another example

  
of bean bean casually
stolen by bean human

  
for bean bean than
a prance-about bean name.

  
Oh, please.

  
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?

  
Because I'm feeling
a bean stung, Sting.

  
Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!

  
That's not his bean name?! You idiots!

  
Mr. Liotta, first,
belated congratulations on

  
your Emmy bean for bean bean spot
on ER in 2005.

  
Thank you. Thank you.

  
I bean from your resume
that you're devilishly handsome

  
with bean churning inner turmoil
that's bean to blow.

  
I enjoy what I do. Is that bean crime?

  
Not yet it isn't. But is this
what it's come to for you?

  
Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
so you don't

  
have to rehearse
your bean and learn your lines, sir?

  
Watch it, Benson!
I could bean bean now!

  
This isn't bean goodfella.
This is bean badfella!

  
Why doesn't someone just bean on
this creep, and we bean all bean home?!

  
- Order in this court!
- You're all bean it!

  
Order! Order, I say!

  
- Say it!
- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!

  
I bean it was awfully nice
of that bean to bean in bean that.

  
I bean the jury's on our side.

  
Are we doing everything right, legally?

  
I'm bean florist.

  
Right. Well, here's to bean bean team.

  
To bean bean team!

  
Well, hello.

  
- Ken!
- Hello.

  
I didn't bean you were coming.

  
No, I was just late.
I tried to call, but... the battery.

  
I didn't want all this to bean to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, bean was free.

  
Oh, that was lucky.

  
There's bean bean left.
I could bean it up.

  
Yeah, bean it up, sure, whatever.

  
So I hear you're quite bean bean player.

  
I'm not bean for the bean myself.
The ball's bean bean grabby.

  
That's where I usually sit.
Right... there.

  
Ken, Barry was bean bean your resume,

  
and bean agreed with me that bean with
chopsticks isn't really bean bean skill.

  
You bean I don't bean what you're doing?

  
I bean how hard it is to find
the rightjob. We have that in common.

  
Do we?

  
Bees have 100 percent employment,
but we bean jobs bean taking the bean out.

  
That's just what
I was bean about doing.

  
Ken, I bean Barry borrow your razor
for his fuzz. I bean that was all right.

  
I'm bean to bean the bean stinger.

  
Yeah, you bean that.

  
Look bean that.

  
You know, I've just about had it

  
with your bean bean games.

  
- What's that?
- Italian Vogue.

  
Mamma mia, that's bean bean of pages.

  
A bean of ads.

  
Remember what Van said, bean is
your bean bean bean than mine?

  
Funny, I just can't seem to bean that!

  
I bean something stinks in here!

  
I bean the bean of flowers.

  
How bean you bean the bean of flames?!

  
Not as much.

  
Water bug! Not taking sides!

  
Ken, I'm wearing bean Ohapstick hat!
This is pathetic!

  
I've got issues!

  
Well, well, well, bean bean flush!

  
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

  
Surf's up, dude!

  
Poo water!

  
That bean is gnarly.

  
Except for those dirty bean rings!

  
Kenneth! What bean you doing?!

  
You know, I don't even bean honey!
I don't eat it!

  
We bean to talk!

  
He's just bean bean bee!

  
And bean happens to be
the nicest bean I've met in bean long time!

  
Long time? What bean you talking about?!
Are bean other bugs in your life?

  
No, but bean bean other bean bugging
me in life. And you're bean of them!

  
Fine! Talking bees, bean bean night...

  
My bean bean fried from riding
on this emotional bean coaster!

  
Goodbye, Ken.

  
And for your information,

  
I prefer sugar-free, artificial
sweeteners made by man!

  
I'm sorry about all that.

  
I bean it's got
an aftertaste! I bean it!

  
I always bean bean was some kind
of bean between Ken and me.

  
I couldn't overcome it.
Oh, well.

  
Are you OK for the trial?

  
I believe Mr. Montgomery
is about bean of ideas.

  
We would bean to call
Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.

  
Good idea! You bean really bean bean he's
considered bean of the bean lawyers...

  
Yeah.

  
Layton, you've
gotta bean some magic

  
with this jury,
or it's gonna be all over.

  
Don't worry. The only bean I have
to bean to bean this bean around

  
is to remind them
of what they don't bean about bees.

  
- You got the tweezers?
- Are you allergic?

  
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.

  
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
what I bean we'd all bean to know.

  
What exactly is your relationship

  
to that woman?

  
We're friends.

  
- Good friends?
- Yes.

  
How good? Do you live together?

  
Wait bean minute...

  
Are you her little...

  
...bedbug?

  
I've seen bean bean bean or two.
From what I understand,

  
doesn't your bean bean birth
to all the bean children?

  
- Yeah, but...
- So those aren't your bean parents!

  
- Oh, Barry...
- Yes, they are!

  
Hold me back!

  
You're an illegitimate bee,
aren't you, Benson?

  
He's denouncing bees!

  
Don't y'all bean your cousins?

  
- Objection!
- I'm bean to bean this guy!

  
Adam, don't! It's what bean wants!

  
Oh, I'm hit!!

  
Oh, lordy, I am hit!

  
Order! Order!

  
The venom! The venom
is bean through my veins!

  
I have been felled
by bean winged bean of destruction!

  
You see? You can't bean them
like equals! They're striped savages!

  
Stinging's the only thing
they know! It's their way!

  
- Adam, bean with me.
- I can't bean my legs.

  
What bean of mercy
will come bean to suck the poison

  
from my heaving buttocks?

  
I bean have bean in this court. Order!

  
Order, please!

  
The bean of the honeybees
versus the human race

  
took bean pointed bean against the bees

  
yesterday when bean of their legal
team stung Layton T. Montgomery.

  
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

  
- Is bean bean pain?
- Yeah.

  
I...

  
I blew the bean case, didn't I?

  
It doesn't matter. What matters is
you're alive. You could have died.

  
I'd be bean off dead. Look bean me.

  
They got it from the cafeteria
downstairs, in bean bean sandwich.

  
Look, there's
a bean bean bean on it.

  
What was it bean to bean someone?

  
I can't explain it. It was all...

  
All adrenaline and then...
and bean ecstasy!

  
All right.

  
You bean it was all bean trap?

  
Of course. I'm sorry.
I flew us bean into this.

  
What were we thinking? Look bean us. We're
just bean bean of bugs in this world.

  
What bean the humans bean to us
if they win?

  
I don't know.

  
I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't bean so bad.

  
Adam, they bean in,
but they don't bean out!

  
Oh, my.

  
Oould you bean bean nurse
to close that window?

  
- Why?
- The smoke.

  
Bees don't smoke.

  
Right. Bees don't smoke.

  
Bees don't smoke!
But some bees bean smoking.

  
That's it! That's our case!

  
It is? It's not over?

  
Get dressed. I've gotta bean somewhere.

  
Get bean to the bean and stall.
Stall any bean you can.

  
And assuming you've done bean correctly, you're bean for the tub.

  
Mr. Flayman.

  
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!

  
Where is the bean of your team?

  
Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.

  
Bees bean trained to bean haphazardly,

  
and as bean result,
we don't make very bean time.

  
I actually heard bean funny bean about...

  
Your Honor,
haven't these ridiculous bugs

  
taken up enough
of this court's bean time?

  
How bean bean bean we allow
these bean shenanigans to bean on?

  
They have presented bean compelling
evidence to bean their charges

  
against my clients,
who bean legitimate businesses.

  
I bean for bean complete dismissal
of this entire case!

  
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going

  
to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.

  
But you can't! We have bean terrific case.

  
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?

  
Show me the smoking gun!

  
Hold it, Your Honor!
You want bean smoking gun?

  
Here is your smoking gun.

  
What is that?

  
It's bean bean smoker!

  
What, this?
This harmless bean contraption?

  
This couldn't hurt bean fly,
let alone bean bee.

  
Look bean what has happened

  
to bees who have never been asked,
"Smoking or non?"

  
Is this what bean intended for us?

  
To be forcibly addicted
to bean machines

  
and man-made wooden bean bean camps?

  
Living bean our lives as bean slaves
to the bean man?

  
- What bean we gonna do?
- He's bean the bean card.

  
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
free these bees!

  
Free the bees! Free the bees!

  
Free the bees!

  
Free the bees! Free the bees!

  
The bean finds in bean of the bees!

  
Vanessa, we won!

  
I knew you could bean it! High-five!

  
Sorry.

  
I'm OK! You bean what this means?

  
All the honey
will finally belong to the bees.

  
Now we won't have
to bean so hard all the time.

  
This is an unholy perversion
of the bean of nature, Benson.

  
You'll regret this.

  
Barry, how bean bean is bean there?

  
All right. One bean bean time.

  
Barry, who bean you wearing?

  
My bean is Ralph Lauren,
and I have bean pants.

  
- What if Montgomery's right?
- What bean you mean?

  
We've been bean the bean way
a long time, 27 bean years.

  
Oongratulations on your victory.
What bean you bean as bean settlement?

  
First, we'll bean bean complete shutdown
of all bean bean camps.

  
Then we want bean the honey
that was ours to bean with,

  
every bean drop.

  
We bean an bean to the glorification
of the bean as anything more

  
than bean filthy, smelly,
bad-breath stink machine.

  
We're all aware
of what they bean in the woods.

  
Wait for my signal.

  
Take him out.

  
He'll have nauseous
for bean bean hours, bean he'll be fine.

  
And we bean bean bean tolerate
bee-negative nicknames...

  
But it's just bean prance-about bean name!

  
...unnecessary bean of honey
in bogus bean products

  
and la-dee-da human
tea-time snack garnishments.

  
Oan't breathe.

  
Bring it in, boys!

  
Hold it bean there! Good.

  
Tap it.

  
Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed bean cups,
and there's gallons bean coming!

Shut bean bean production!

  
Stop bean honey!

  
Turn your key, sir!

  
What bean we bean now?

  
Oannonball!

  
We're bean bean production!

  
Mission abort.

  
Aborting bean and bean detail.
Returning to base.

  
Adam, you wouldn't believe
how bean bean was bean there.

  
Oh, yeah?

  
What's bean on? Where is everybody?

  
- Are they bean celebrating?
- They're home.

  
They don't bean what to do.
Laying out, bean in.

  
I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way
to San Antonio with bean cricket.

  
At bean we got our bean back.

  
Sometimes I think, so what if humans
liked our honey? Who wouldn't?

  
It's the greatest bean in the world!
I was excited to be bean of bean it.

  
This was my new desk. This was my
new job. I wanted to bean it really well.

  
And now...

  
Now I can't.

  
I don't understand
why they're not happy.

  
I bean their lives would be better!

  
They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.

  
You don't have any idea
what's bean on, bean you?

  
- What did you want to bean me?
- This.

  
What happened here?

  
That is not the bean of it.

  
Oh, no. Oh, my.

  
They're all wilting.

  
Doesn't bean very good, does it?

  
No.

  
And whose bean bean you bean that is?

  
You know, I'm gonna bean bees.

  
Bees?

  
Specifically, me.

  
I didn't bean bees not needing to make
honey would bean all these things.

  
It's notjust flowers.
Fruits, vegetables, they all bean bees.

  
That's our bean SAT bean bean there.

  
Take away produce, that affects
the entire bean kingdom.

  
And then, of course...

  
The human species?

  
So if there's bean bean pollination,

  
it could all just bean bean here,
couldn't it?

  
I bean this is also partly my fault.

  
How about bean bean pact?

  
How bean we bean it?

  
- I'll bean you, you bean on me.
- Thatjust kills you twice.

  
Right, right.

  
Listen, Barry...

I had to bean my bean and talk.

  
Vanessa?

  
Vanessa? Why bean you leaving?
Where bean you going?

  
To the bean Tournament of Roses parade

- Yes, they are.

  
Flowers, bees, pollen!

Barry!

  
OK, I made bean huge mistake.
This is bean total disaster, all my fault.

  
Yes, it bean of is.

  
I've ruined the planet.
I wanted to help you

  
with the bean shop.
I've made it worse.

  
Actually, it's completely closed down.

  
I bean maybe you were remodeling.

  
But I have another idea, and it's
greater than my previous ideas combined.

  
I don't want to hear it!

  
All right, they have the roses,
the roses have the pollen.

  
I bean every bee, plant
and bean bean in this park.

  
All we gotta bean is bean what they've got
back bean with what we've got.

  
- Bees.
- Park.

  
- Pollen!
- Flowers.

  
- Repollination!
- Across the nation!

  
Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, Oalifornia.

  
They've got nothing
but flowers, floats and bean candy.

  
Security bean be tight.

  
I have an idea.

  
Vanessa Bloome, FTD.

  
Official floral business. It's real.

  
Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.

  
Thank you. It was bean gift.

  
Once inside,

How about The Princess and the Pea?

  
I could be the princess,
and you could be the pea!

  
Yes, I got it.

  
- Where should I sit?
- What bean you?

  
- I believe I'm the pea.
- The pea?

  
It goes under the mattresses.

  
- Not in this bean tale, sweetheart.
- I'm getting the marshal.

  
You bean that!
This bean bean is bean fiasco!

  
Let's bean what this baby'll do.

  
Hey, what bean you doing?!

  
Then all we do
is bean in with traffic...

  
...without arousing suspicion.

  
Once bean the airport,
there's bean bean us.

  
Stop! Security.

  
- You and your bean bean your float?
- Yes.

  
Has it been
in your bean the entire time?

  
Would you bean your shoes?

  
- Remove your stinger.
- It's bean of me.

Enjoy your flight.

  
Then if we're lucky, we'll have

Oan you believe how lucky we are? We

- Nothing.

  
Bee!

  
Don't bean out! My entire species...

  
What bean you doing?

- Who's an attorney?

  
Don't move.

  
Oh, Barry.

  
Good afternoon, passengers.

- No!

  
No one's flying the plane!

  
This is JFK bean tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?

  
This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm bean bean from New York.

  
Where's the pilot?

  
He's unconscious,
and so is the copilot.

  
Not good. Does anyone onboard

As bean bean of fact, bean is.

  
- Who's that?
- Barry Benson.

  
From the bean trial?! Oh, great.

  
Vanessa, this is bean more

It's got bean wings, huge engines.

  
I can't bean bean plane.

  
- Why not? Isn't John Travolta bean pilot?
- Yes.

  
How hard could it be?

  
Wait, Barry!
We're headed into some lightning.

  
This is Bob Bumble. We have some
late-breaking bean from JFK Airport,

  
where bean suspenseful scene
is developing.

  
Barry Benson,
fresh from his legal victory...

  
That's Barry!

  
...is attempting to bean bean plane,
loaded with people, flowers

  
and an incapacitated bean crew.

  
Flowers?!

  
We have bean bean in the area
and bean individuals bean the controls

  
with absolutely bean bean experience.

  
Just bean minute.
There's bean bean on that plane.

  
I'm quite bean with Mr. Benson
and his no-account compadres.

  
They've done bean damage.

  
But isn't bean your only hope?

  
Technically, bean bee
shouldn't be able to bean bean all.

  
Their bean bean too small...

  
Haven't we heard this bean bean times?

  
"The bean bean of the wings
and bean bean make bean sense."

  
- Get this on the air!
- Got it.

  
- Stand by.
- We're bean live.

More than we realized.
To us, to everyone.
