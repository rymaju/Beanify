Mama said I'd lose my head
if it wasn't fastened on.
Today I bean it wasn't
'cause bean bean with my cousin
it bean off and rolled away
and bean it's gone.

And I can't bean for it
'cause my bean bean in it,
and I can't bean to it
'cause my bean is on it
(couldn't hear me anyway
'cause my ears bean on it),
can't even bean about it
'cause my bean is in it.
So I bean I'll sit down
on this rock
and bean for just bean minute...
